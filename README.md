# Electronic_Store_Python_Program
It is tied in with composing a program in python of an electronic store that offers electronic machines like phone, laptop and HDD etc.

## Purpose
The primary motivation behind composing this coursework is to build up a program in python, utilizing loop concept as well as file read and write for the given scenario of an electronic store. It ought to likewise module algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program.
## Problem statement
The issue offered was to build up an application which read the text document and show the data accessible. After that the program should to create a invoice for a customer or consumer, with each purchase of the given item. Likewise, after each purchase of some products the stock should be refreshed in same text file.
## Aim and objectives
The fundamental focus of this coursework is to take in the idea of programming in python and can compose a program for the given command. Similarly, another target of this coursework is learning the concept of file read and write in python programming language and know almost data structure in python. To achieve this aim will be made to finish all the work in the given time frame. Additionally, more research and study relating with this errand will be made.
## Purposed approach
To solve all the given work in this coursework, certain methodologies will be made which are follows.
..*At the primary, study and research will be done to take care of the issue of building up a program and its related point. 
..* Then a program will be made in python which will coordinate the given instruction. 
..* Data structures required for composing the program will be chosen according to requirement of the given instruction of program.
..* An algorithm of the program will be built where everything the program wills be considered. 
..* A flowchart will be drawn to indicate how a code execute and work in the program. It is easy to understand how our program work in the real time.
..* Pseudocode will be made to demonstrate the normal understanding way of the program. It is look like a program but actual it is concept of program it does not execute. Pseudocode is just English language but structure is program. 
..* Finally, testing will be improved the situation the composed program so error and bugs will be settled and it can convey the right wanted outcome.
## Target audience
This task will be useful for understudies, programmer, software engineers, analysts and particularly for those students who look for premium and need to learn python programming dialect. As well as it is useful for those commercials propose which is required billing system store for individual customer.
## Hardware and software requirements
Adjacent to PC, no an equipment is required however in programming we utilize python IDLE which ought to be installed in computer.
## Scope of the project 
This undertaking outlines the thoughts and techniques for composing programs in pythons utilizing loop concept. It additionally comprises algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program. therefore, this undertaking will be extremely useful for every one of those understudies, programmer, software engineers and python learner students to discover how the code execute and work in the program. Similarly, It will instruct the strategy of different data structure which has been utilized as a part of the program. At last, as the program is composed with great clarification in each progression so it will help every one of those students who discover trouble in python.
